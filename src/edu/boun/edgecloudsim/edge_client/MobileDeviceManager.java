//DatacenterBroker:  is responsible for mediating negotiations between SaaS and Cloud providers;
//and such negotiations are driven by QoS requirements. It acts on behalf of applications.
//It discovers suitable Cloud service providers by querying the CIS and undertakes online
//negotiations for allocation of resources/services that can meet the applicationâ€™s QoS needs.
//Researchers and system developers must extend this class for evaluating and testing custom
//brokering policies. The broker represents the customer (i.e. decisions of these components
//are made in order to increase user-related performance metrics), whereas the CloudCoordinator
//acts on behalf of the data center, i.e. it tries to maximize the overall performance of
//the data center, without considering the needs of specific customers.
